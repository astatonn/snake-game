# Snake
 This is the Snake game based on web and using Firebase

## Requirements

This web app is based on Firebase and it's services like:

1. Analytics
2. Authentication
3. Firestore  
4. Hosting

For hosting, the [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) too will be required. 

## Authentication

This app is using [Firebase Auth UI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli).
This is an awesome prebuilt tool that handles the Firebase authentication flow
with a nice UI. 

For now, we will use:

1. Google sign in
2. Email and password

## The Game

This will be a multiplayer game. A player will sign in and will be paired
with any other available player. 

One of the players will be controlling the snake while the other one will
be adding obstacles.
